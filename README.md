## The Asciify Project

Asciify is as simple as is sounds: turn an image to its equivalent using Ascii characters. This transformation occurs by mapping the value of the pixels composing an image to a selection of characters so that the intensity of the color matches the amount of space occupied by the character. 

This project features the Asciify module as well as the integration with Twitter, GitHub and GitLab APIs to provide a bot that is able to reply to your mentions with an _asciified_ version of the image tweeted, as well as a link to a GitHub page were you can copy the characters that compose your image. 

It is entirely built in Python, featuring [Tweepy](http://docs.tweepy.org/en/latest/), [PyGitHub](https://pygithub.readthedocs.io/en/latest/introduction.html) and [python-gitlab](https://python-gitlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) to manage the Twitter, GitHub and GitLab APIs, and [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) for image processing. 

In order for the images to be as straight as possible, a [_monospace_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monospaced_font) font is required. For this particular project we used the [JetBrains Mono Typeface](https://github.com/JetBrains/JetBrainsMono), but any monospace font should be fine. 

For any issue or suggestion, feel free to open a new [issue](https://github.com/ArrobaRicardoGE/Asciify/issues), or DM me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ArrobaRicardoGE). 

Hope you enjoy! :)
